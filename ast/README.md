# The RemixDB AST

The RemixDB AST serves to take the syntax for the database language and turn it into many tokens which can be used to handle events within the database. You can see all of the possible tokens within `tokens.go`. To make things simple, the only things exposed are the tokens, the `Parse` method (which takes a string and returns `([]any, *ParserError)` where `any` in this case refers to a token in the tokens file), and `ParserError` which defines the position of an error and the message to display.

Testing of the AST is done via the `parser_test.go` file and `TestParse`. The way this works is you add tests inside `testdata/tests/<category>/<filename>`, and then they get picked up. The results folder inside of `testdata` stores all of the test results. When ran alone, it will error if the file does not exist in results or if it is different. This is so you can check if your code breaks previous expectations. If you are intending to update the tests, you can use `make results-update` to do this. `<<R>>` repersents `\r`.
